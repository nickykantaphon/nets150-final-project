Project description:
The program scrapes data about NBA teams and players from the ESPN website. 
In particular, each player's college and hometown is also recorded.
Using this data, the program allows the user to: 1) find the smallest
number of connections between two player (can be connected by same college, hometwon
or team), 2) find a recommended team based on an input college and 3) find a
recommended team based on an input hometown.

Implementation project including the following concepts:
- Document search
- Graph and graph algorithms (adjacency matrix, BFS)
- Social Affiliation Networks (focal closure, membership closure)
